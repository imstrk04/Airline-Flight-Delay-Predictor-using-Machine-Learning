This project addresses a significant challenge in air travel by leveraging flight and weather data from 2016 and 2017 to predict delays at 15 major airports across the United States.
The core of this project is a dual-stage machine learning model that combines classification and regression methods. The first stage employs a binary classifier to determine whether a flight will be delayed by 15 minutes or more. For flights predicted to be delayed, a second-stage regression model estimates the exact delay duration in minutes.
Data preparation was a crucial aspect of this project. It involved comprehensive collection and preprocessing of both flight and weather data. To address the common issue of class imbalance in the classification task, I implemented SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). This approach significantly improved the model's performance on the minority class.
The results of this project are promising. The classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.92, effectively distinguishing between delayed and on-time flights. The regression model, tasked with predicting the precise delay duration, reached an impressive accuracy of 0.94.
A key focus of the project was optimizing and normalizing input variables to achieve the best fit for both regression and classification tasks. I used various features to forecast delays, ensuring the model's robustness and reliability. The project also involved extensive exploratory data analysis to refine the features and enhance the model's predictive power.
To evaluate the regression model's performance, I calculated the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which provided valuable insights into the accuracy of predicted delay durations. The final model selection was based on the best accuracy from logistic regression for classification and the highest R2 value from linear regression.
This project demonstrates the power of combining classification and regression techniques in solving real-world problems. It has been an invaluable learning experience, deepening my understanding of machine learning applications in the aviation industry.
